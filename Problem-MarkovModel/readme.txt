inside.txt and outside.txt are the two Markov models, which should be used as input to your classification program.

test1.txt and test2.txt are two input files for testing your program. 
During grading, we will use more testing files. Note that each line may have different length. The size of each sequence is not fixed. It totally depends on the input file. 

Don't hard code any input parameters because we will change them during testing. For example, my testing file may be named as "test3.txt" or "inputdata". And the sequence may have 1000 characters in my testing inputs.
